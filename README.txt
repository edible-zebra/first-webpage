This is my first programming project, the goal is to create a functional website from the ground up.

Currently, I only have foundational knowledge of HTML, but I intend to use JavaScript to streamline
the process of adding content to the page once I've learning how to use JavaScript. Consider this a
version 0.0.1.

----------------------------------------DESCRIPTION & PLAN------------------------------------------

The development plan is fill the webpage with content using solely HTML, this will be the beginning
phase of the project which will ultimately culminate in version 0.0.2.

Then, I will implement CSS to make the website more visually pleasing and user friendly, once the
foundation has been set down for a professional looking site with CSS, that will be version 0.0.3.

Version 0.0.4 will use JavaScript to change the process of adding posts. Version 0.0.3 and lower
will all be adding content directly via HTML. From 0.0.4 and forward, content will be added directly
from the webpage using credentials.

Version 0.0.5 will be using JavaScript to add options for user input such as comments, user posts,
and more dynamic webpages.

Once these steps are achieved, work will begin to make version 0.1.0, which will be a functioning,
asthetic, and useful site being hosted on a domain.

Currently, there is no domain hosting the site. In order to view the site in it's entirety you must
download the "Personal Dev Blog" folder and open the index.html file, or if you choose to view one specific page then
you must download the "page".html and then open it with your web browser of choice. The website is
functional on PC and mobile, including safari via iPhone.
