                        Originally, I was very stuborn in my approach towards programming. Despite the fact that I've always been very capable of learning quickly, there is always a sense of anxiety that comes over me when confronted with the task of learning a
                        new language; which is ironic because I was originally born in Romania and moved to the United States early on in my childhood, so for me learning a new language wasn't just a hard task, it was a necessary one. This fear I had about learning
                        new languages affected my confidence when approaching programming, and it affected it in a rather negative way. Initially I thought, "There is no way I can learn a programming language without the guidance of an instructor."

                        <p>
                        Luckily, the technical college nearby was offering free tuition for in-state students, and I jumped at the opportunity. I've always been very interested in computer technology, and I've even built my own computers on numerous occasions. I
                        figured this would be the perfect opportunity to start my journey into programming. I've never had a problem in subjects like Math and English, and I placed high enough on my placement tests to get directly into the classes that I would need
                        to begin my degree. I started MAT-105, Introduction to College Algebra, and ENG-101, as well as CPT-257, Operating Systems, and CPT-113, Information Systems. Very quickly, I flunked every one of my classes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        You see, I mentioned previously that I've never had a problem learning; well that didn't change. My problem wasn't learning, it was earning. Me and my girlfriend just had a baby, and now a new one on the way, and money was always in short
                        supply. So I thought I could make a little extra money to help out at home and also continue my classes by working at a nearby McDonalds, but what happened in reality was that my attendence in class dropped and I was withdrawn, and I ended
                        up getting fired from McDonalds because I was missing work days or coming in late too often. I tried to live the life of a student and a worker, and just ended up failing at both. It was crippling, and I considered that maybe computer science
                        was a field reserved for people who had the time and money to get through college, but not for me.

                        Regardless I continued to pursue this career, my family needed me to. I re-enrolled in my previously flunked classes and concentrated my efforts towards graduating. As I worked on school, I also stumbled upon some Youtube videos which talked
                        about different web browser options; this isn't going to be important just yet, but keep it in mind. The semester passed by and I was keeping a solid 3.8 GPA and I was becoming very confident, but as is the trend in my life, money problems
                        once again started to get in the way of my education. Not only did I just not have money, but due to a mistake I made when filing my taxes I actually ended up paying the IRS money and also prolonged the amount of time it would take for my
                        girlfriend to recieve her tax return. I ended up getting a job again, and got dropped from my ENG-101 class for attendence again. This was a very disheartening moment for my educational career.

                        So you remember how I mentioned some Youtube video's talking about web browsers? Well one of the video's was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14OjfjPxCHg">this video</a> posted by Austin Evans on Youtube. The video talks about the
                        new update of Microsoft Edge Dev and it's ChatGPT integration with Bing. This was mind-blowing to me, especially because despite hearing so much about ChatGPT I had refused to check it out myself. I immediately installed Microsoft Edge Dev
                        and opted-in to BingGPT, and the very first thing I did was ask it to write an email for me (which it did splendidly). I was so impressed that I annoyed my girlfriend to death talking about it, and then called my good friend Arvin to talk
                        about it with him. As an older guy (who had an even old<strong>er</strong> dad) he saw the same potential I did, this functionality could turn even the average user into a power user. Not only did Edge run smoother than Chrome, the BingGPT feature was going to be the future of web browsing.

                        <p>
                        We began to plot, we believed this would be the future and we wanted in on it. We thought, "what can we do to be pioneers on this internet expedition?" That's where the thinking ended for that day however, our minds were already racing with
                        the implications this had on our own lives and productivity, so we just let the idea of capitalizing on this feature sit in our minds and marinate. And finally, one morning, I woke up and thought about how annoying the process of sending
                        emails with the compose tab really was.
